Team Members: Gregory  Katchmar (launch driver), Cheryl Cruz, Jade Dhabolt, Nathan Pickard, Rosemary Joe

Problem Statement: Yelp doesn’t allow a method to see when restaurants are open at a future time

Scope: limited to weekend brunch restaurants

Project Pitch: app lets user input desired time, preferred neighborhood, maybe get browser location to show nearby restaurants (if doable), provides links to restaurant website, provide user opportunity to review app, use a Google Map of all locations and also filter by time and neighborhood, maybe have short cuisine/price description/photos?


First page: location awareness provides list of nearby restaurants (if user opts to allow), then provides user opportunity to launch refined search or Google Map
Second page: user can enter time and neighborhood to get a different set of restaurants
Third page: Google Map of the restaurants

All restaurants will be linked to their website

Store last user’s settings in local storage.
